Interractive Web Development Assignment 1

QUESTION 1

I have created a Motorsport Showcase and Automotive Enthusiast website tilted "Craig Motorsport". the website contians technical specifications, performance data and imageryfor three high-performance vehicles: the BMW M2cs, the GOLF GTI MK 7R, and the Mercedes Benz C63s. It also includes a contact section for community engagement.

QUESTION 2.1: HTML Elements

1.) <nav>: Managing internal page anchors ( using href="#id") required precise coordination between the links and the sections IDs
2.)<img>: Ensuring the file paths were correct for local images ( using the f:/drive) and providing meaningful alt text for accessibility.
3.)<div> Using these to group images without a css stylesheet required careful nesting to keep the layout organized.
<section>: Applying semantic meaning to different car models while keeping the code readable.
3.)<a>: Implementing different protocols like tel: and mailto: ( or custom message links ) to ensure they behaved correctly as functional links

  QUESTION 2.2
  
I used <nav> to wrap the primary navigation links, <section> to define distinct areas for each specific car model, and <footer> at the bottom to house copyright information. This ensures search engines readers understand the  hierarchy of the page.



QUESTION 2.3

The <section> element was the most useful. Bygiving each a uniqueid ( like id="m2"), I was able to create a functional navigation menu that allows users to jump directly to specific content on the same page.

QUESTION 3.1

1.) href: Essential for the navigation links and content links to work
2.) src: critical for displaying the images of the vehicles.
3.) id: Vital for the "anchor" functionally allowing the navigation bar to scroll to the correct section

QUESTION 3.2

I used the id attribute for unique ono-of-a kind sections (like #m2 or #contact) to allow for direct linking. I used the class attribute ( like .car-images) to apply a specific style to mutliple groups of images across the different car sections simultaneously

QUESSTION 3.3

The alt attribute in the <img> tags. It improves accessibility for visually impaired
users and ensure that if a local image fails to load, the user still understands what content was supposed to be there( e.g.,"BMW M2 Exterior").

QUESTION 4.1

I used a "top-down" appeoach:starting with a header/title, followed by a navigation bar for easy access, then repeating specific "data blocks" for each car and ending with contact info.

QUESTION 4.2

My major challenge was lask of external CSS. I overcome this inline styles ( like style="text-align: center;") and internal <style> blocks to ensure the site looked professional despite the technical constraints.

QUESTION 5

1.) git init to start the repository.
2.) git add  . to stage my HTML file.
3.) git commit  -m "Initial commit" to save my progress
4.) git push origin main to upload the code to GitHub

QUESTION 5.2

I made approximately 5-7 commits. My strategy was to commit everytime a new feature was finished ( e.g., "Added BMW section," " Fixed navigation links," "added Footer")

QUESTION 5.3

It acts as a safety net. If I make a mistake that breaks the layout, I can revert to a previous "working" version of the code without losing all my work.

QUESTION 6.1

I manuanlly checked fornclosing tags ( like</div> and </section> and ensured that all attributes were enclosed in quation marks.

QUESTION 6.2

I used indentation to show the nesting of elemnts and included clear id names that matched the content of the sections.

QUESTION 6.3

I would implement a Responsive Grid using CSS flexbox or Grid to make the images stack vertically on mobile phone, and I would add a "Black Top Button". Add a <form> element in the contact section with required attributes to allow users to send inquiries directly "Form Validation".
